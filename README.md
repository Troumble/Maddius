# Maddius
The Maddius Main, built by Marius and Eddie.

Maddius is an Open-Source midi controller, you can build your own.
The idea is to Share our code, 3d files and bill of material with the internet so the topic of midi controllers can be better understood.
Maddius is split in pieces talking to expansions you can build so it fits with your Setup, the i2c signal gets translated to midi by the Teensy 3.6 inside of the Maddius Main.
If you want more informations on the expansions for Maddius feel free to look inside thier respective folder.
Because the Maddius Main is the converter to Midi we recommend to start there.

Ever got tired of over Complicated Dmx Controller or Light Setups in your favorite bar or club you are working at sometimes as a hobby technican? Dont worry no more, even better, impress your "boss" and show them your newly built Maddius Main. Controlling and adapting to your setup. Need 8 Fader and Blind Buttons? No Problem. Need another Expansions with Scene selection or Bank switching? We got you covered. Only want to build your owm Midi Controller? Maybe our code is just for you.
Want to know how to wire a Controller? Check out our Diagramms.

We hope you have fun building and coding.

Greetings, Marius and Eddie.
